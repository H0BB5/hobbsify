# Hobbsify â€“ A serverless spotfy implementation 
As a personal challenge I have decided to try and create a serverless Spotify clone.

## Stack
* React/Next.js
* Typescript
* A bootstrapped UI for speed (undecided on which one)
* Postgres for db 

### Success Criteria
* Should have user login/authentication 
* Artist library 
* Songs should be associated to each Artist 
* Playlist creation with association to each user 
* Song playback 
* Runs serverless with hosted database 


### Postgres DB is hosted on Google Cloud 
* Normally wouldn't include .env file but to run locally it is in here with the access credentials
 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
